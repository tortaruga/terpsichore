We are the keepers of those soul-fragments that glint in the fleeting moments we succeedâ€”the heart-wrenching beauty that makes us crumble on our knees, the unrestrainable joy that drums in our feet, the desire to cry when someone seems to glide, soft as a feather, on the wind of another world.
Enjoy your stay.</p>
